LNRS aims to capture all Canadian sanctions sources in this watchlist. On or around 31 July 2019, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) ceased posting its own lists of entities because the lists are available from other public sources. These sources include Global Affairs Canada (GAC), Public Safety Canada, Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolutions on the Suppression of Terrorism (RIUNRST), and the Regulations Establishing a List of Entities. The designated persons published therein are contained in the OSFI Consolidated List watchlist. GAC also refers to the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List (UNCL). You may also wish to include the LNRS UN Consolidated list in order to help meet your financial sanctions compliance program for Canada.",
